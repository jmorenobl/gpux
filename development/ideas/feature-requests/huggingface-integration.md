# [PLANNING] Multi-Registry Model Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Author**: Jorge MB
**Category**: Feature Request
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Large

## Summary

Enable users to directly pull and run models from multiple model registries (Hugging Face, ONNX Model Zoo, TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch Hub, etc.) using simple CLI commands like `gpux pull microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` and `gpux run microsoft/DialoGPT-medium "Hello, how are you?"`. This would eliminate the need for manual model downloading, conversion, and configuration, making GPUX incredibly user-friendly and powerful across the entire ML ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users must manually:
1. Find and download models from various registries (Hugging Face, ONNX Model Zoo, TensorFlow Hub, etc.)
2. Convert models to ONNX format (if needed)
3. Create and configure `gpux.yml` files
4. Handle model-specific preprocessing/postprocessing
5. Manage model versions and updates across different platforms

This creates a significant barrier to entry and limits GPUX's usability, especially for users who want to quickly experiment with different models from different sources or don't have deep ML expertise.

## Proposed Solution

### Core CLI Commands
```bash
# Pull model from any supported registry
gpux pull <model-id> [--registry <registry>] [--revision <revision>] [--cache-dir <dir>]

# Run model with automatic input handling
gpux run <model-id> [--input <text>] [--file <file>] [--interactive]

# Search for models across registries
gpux search "sentiment analysis" [--registry <registry>] [--limit 10]

# Show model information
gpux info <model-id> [--registry <registry>]

# List locally available models
gpux list

# Remove cached model
gpux remove <model-id>

# List supported registries
gpux registries
```

### Enhanced GPUXfile Support
```yaml
# Auto-generated from any supported registry
name: microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
version: 1.0.0
source: huggingface  # or onnx-zoo, tensorflow-hub, pytorch-hub, etc.

model:
  id: microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
  registry: huggingface
  revision: main
  format: onnx  # Auto-convert if needed

inputs:
  text:
    type: string
    max_length: 1024

outputs:
  generated_text:
    type: string

runtime:
  gpu:
    memory: 4GB
    backend: auto
```

### Architecture: Strategy Pattern with ModelManager Interface

```python
# Core interface for all model registries
class ModelManager(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pull_model(self, model_id: str, **kwargs) -> ModelInfo:
        """Download and prepare model from registry"""

    @abstractmethod
    def search_models(self, query: str, **kwargs) -> List[ModelInfo]:
        """Search for models in registry"""

    @abstractmethod
    def get_model_info(self, model_id: str) -> ModelInfo:
        """Get model metadata without downloading"""

# Concrete implementations
class HuggingFaceManager(ModelManager): ...
class ONNXModelZooManager(ModelManager): ...
class TensorFlowHubManager(ModelManager): ...
class PyTorchHubManager(ModelManager): ...
class MLflowManager(ModelManager): ...
class WeightsAndBiasesManager(ModelManager): ...
```

### Smart Model Detection

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- **Multi-registry integration** - Support for multiple model registries
- **Model conversion** - Convert models from various formats to ONNX
- **Caching system** - Local model cache with version management
- **Model detection** - Auto-detect model type and create appropriate configs
- **Error handling** - Robust error handling for download/conversion failures
- **Progress indicators** - Show download and conversion progress
- **Registry abstraction** - Strategy pattern for different registry implementations

### Dependencies
- `huggingface-hub>=0.20.0` - Hugging Face model downloading
- `transformers>=4.30.0` - Model loading and conversion
- `torch>=2.0.0` - For PyTorch model conversion
- `tensorflow>=2.13.0` - For TensorFlow model conversion
- `onnx>=1.15.0` - ONNX model handling
- `tokenizers>=0.15.0` - For text preprocessing
- `datasets>=2.14.0` - For model metadata and search
- `mlflow>=2.8.0` - MLflow model registry support
- `wandb>=0.16.0` - Weights & Biases integration

### Risks and Challenges
- **Model conversion complexity** - Some models may not convert cleanly to ONNX
  - *Mitigation*: Fallback to original format, better error messages
- **Large model downloads** - Some models are several GB
  - *Mitigation*: Progress indicators, resume capability, optional compression
- **Model compatibility** - Not all Hugging Face models work with ONNX Runtime
  - *Mitigation*: Pre-validation, compatibility matrix, fallback options
- **Performance overhead** - Conversion adds time on first use
  - *Mitigation*: Caching, background conversion, pre-converted models

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual model management** - Current approach, too complex for users
- **Model registry only** - Building our own registry, too much work and limited models
- **Git LFS integration** - Using Git for model storage, not suitable for large models
- **External model APIs** - Calling Hugging Face APIs directly, loses local control

## Success Criteria

## Notes

This feature would be a **game-changer** for GPUX adoption. The combination of:
- Multiple model registries (Hugging Face, ONNX Model Zoo, TensorFlow Hub, etc.)
- GPUX's universal GPU compatibility
- Docker-like UX
- Strategy pattern architecture for extensibility

...creates a unique value proposition that no other ML runtime currently offers.

The technical implementation is challenging but feasible, and the user value is enormous. This could be the feature that makes GPUX the go-to solution for ML inference deployment.

**Key insight**: Users don't want to manage models - they want to use them. This feature eliminates the friction between "I want to try this model" and "I'm running inference."

**Architecture insight**: Using the strategy pattern with `ModelManager` interface makes this feature future-proof and allows easy addition of new registries as they emerge. This is much better than hardcoding Hugging Face integration.
