# Ideas and Brainstorming

This directory contains all brainstorming, feature ideas, and concept exploration for the GPUX project.

## Subdirectories

- `feature-requests/` - User-requested features and enhancements
- `technical-ideas/` - Technical concepts and architectural ideas
- `research-notes/` - Research findings and external inspiration

## Idea Lifecycle

1. **Capture** - Document the idea with context and motivation
2. **Evaluate** - Assess feasibility, impact, and alignment with project goals
3. **Prioritize** - Rank ideas based on value, effort, and strategic importance
4. **Plan** - Break down selected ideas into actionable tasks
5. **Implement** - Move to implementation tracking when ready
6. **Archive** - Document outcomes and lessons learned

## Idea Template

Use the `TEMPLATE_IDEA.md` file as a starting point for documenting new ideas.

## Status Labels

- `[DRAFT]` - Initial idea capture, needs refinement
- `[EVALUATING]` - Under consideration and evaluation
- `[PRIORITIZED]` - Approved for implementation planning
- `[PLANNING]` - Being broken down into tasks
- `[IMPLEMENTING]` - Moved to implementation phase
- `[COMPLETED]` - Successfully implemented
- `[REJECTED]` - Not pursued, with rationale
- `[DEFERRED]` - Postponed for future consideration

## Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating ideas, consider:

- **Value**: How much value does this provide to users?
- **Effort**: What's the development cost and complexity?
- **Alignment**: Does this fit with project vision and goals?
- **Dependencies**: What other work is required first?
- **Risk**: What are the potential risks and mitigation strategies?
- **Timeline**: When would this be most valuable to implement?

## Cross-References

- Link ideas to related research in `../research/`
- Reference implementation tasks in `../implementation/`
- Connect to architectural decisions in `../decisions/`
- Link to relevant GitHub issues and pull requests
