# [CURRENT] Multi-Registry Model Integration Phase 1

**Phase ID**: PHASE-2025-01
**Start Date**: 2025-10-27
**Target End Date**: 2025-11-10
**Actual End Date**: TBD
**Owner**: Jorge MB
**Category**: Feature
**Priority**: High

## Overview

Implement the foundational architecture for multi-registry model integration using a strategy pattern with `ModelManager` interface. This phase establishes the core infrastructure needed to pull and run models from different registries (starting with Hugging Face) with automatic ONNX conversion and configuration generation.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Implement `ModelManager` interface and strategy pattern architecture
- Create `HuggingFaceManager` as the first concrete implementation
- Add basic `gpux pull` command with registry selection
- Enable automatic ONNX conversion for text models
- Establish model caching and version management system

### Secondary Goals
- Create comprehensive test suite for model integration
- Add progress indicators for model downloads and conversions
- Implement robust error handling and user feedback
- Document the architecture and usage patterns

## Scope

### In Scope
- Core `ModelManager` interface design and implementation
- `HuggingFaceManager` for Hugging Face Hub integration
- Basic `gpux pull` command with registry selection
- ONNX conversion for popular text models (BERT, GPT variants)
- Model caching system with version management
- Auto-generation of `gpux.yml` configurations
- Integration with existing GPUX runtime system

### Out of Scope
- Support for other registries (ONNX Model Zoo, TensorFlow Hub, etc.) - Phase 2
- Advanced model type detection - Phase 2
- Cross-registry search functionality - Phase 2
- Batch operations and advanced features - Phase 3

## Deliverables

- [ ] `ModelManager` abstract base class with core interface
- [ ] `HuggingFaceManager` concrete implementation
- [ ] Enhanced CLI with `gpux pull` command
- [ ] Model caching and version management system
- [ ] ONNX conversion pipeline for text models
- [ ] Auto-generation of `gpux.yml` configurations
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration tests)
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and validation

## Success Criteria

- Users can pull and run 5+ popular Hugging Face models in under 30 seconds
- Model conversion success rate > 90% for supported text models
- Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated model usage
- All core functionality works on Apple Silicon, NVIDIA, and AMD GPUs
- CLI feels natural and intuitive to Docker users

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Existing GPUX runtime system (✅ Complete)
- ONNX Runtime with execution providers (✅ Complete)
- Basic CLI infrastructure (✅ Complete)

### Blockers
- None identified

### Parallel Work
- Documentation can be written alongside implementation
- Test cases can be developed in parallel with features

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Notes |

| HuggingFace Integration | 2025-11-02 | [ ] | HuggingFaceManager + basic pull command |
| ONNX Conversion | 2025-11-05 | [ ] | Text model conversion pipeline |
| Testing & Validation | 2025-11-08 | [ ] | Comprehensive test suite |
| Documentation & Polish | 2025-11-10 | [ ] | Docs, examples, final validation |

## Resources

### Team Members
- Lead Developer: Jorge MB
- Architecture Review: TBD
- Testing: TBD

### External Resources
- Hugging Face Hub API documentation
- ONNX conversion best practices
- Docker CLI patterns for UX reference

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Model conversion failures | High | Medium | Implement fallback mechanisms, better error messages |
| Large model download times | Medium | High | Progress indicators, resume capability, compression |
| Memory issues with large models | Medium | Medium | Memory limits, streaming downloads, cleanup |
| API rate limiting | Low | Medium | Implement retry logic, caching, respect rate limits |

## Progress Tracking

### Week 1 (2025-10-27 to 2025-11-02)
- [ ] Design and implement `ModelManager` interface
- [ ] Create `HuggingFaceManager` implementation
- [ ] Add basic `gpux pull` command
- [ ] Set up model caching system

### Week 2 (2025-11-03 to 2025-11-10)
- [ ] Implement ONNX conversion pipeline
- [ ] Add auto-generation of `gpux.yml` configurations
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Write documentation and examples

## Outcomes

### Achievements
- TBD (to be filled as phase progresses)

### Lessons Learned
- TBD (to be filled as phase progresses)

### Next Steps
- Move to Phase 2: Additional Registries (ONNX Model Zoo, TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch Hub)
- Expand model type detection capabilities
- Add cross-registry search functionality

## Notes

This phase establishes the foundational architecture that will enable all future registry integrations. The strategy pattern approach ensures that adding new registries in future phases will be straightforward and maintainable.

**Key Success Factor**: The `ModelManager` interface must be designed carefully to accommodate the different APIs and capabilities of various registries while maintaining a consistent user experience.
