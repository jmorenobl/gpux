## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Implement `ModelManager` interface and strategy pattern architecture
- Create `HuggingFaceManager` as the first concrete implementation
- Add basic `gpux pull` command with registry selection
- Enable automatic ONNX conversion for text models
- Establish model caching and version management system

### Secondary Goals
- Create comprehensive test suite for model integration
- Add progress indicators for model downloads and conversions
- Implement robust error handling and user feedback
- Document the architecture and usage patterns

## Scope

### In Scope

## Notes

This phase establishes the foundational architecture that will enable all future registry integrations. The strategy pattern approach ensures that adding new registries in future phases will be straightforward and maintainable.

**Key Success Factor**: The `ModelManager` interface must be designed carefully to accommodate the different APIs and capabilities of various registries while maintaining a consistent user experience.
