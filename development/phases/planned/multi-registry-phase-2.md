# [PLANNED] Multi-Registry Model Integration Phase 2

**Phase ID**: PHASE-2025-02
**Start Date**: 2025-11-11
**Target End Date**: 2025-11-25
**Actual End Date**: TBD
**Owner**: Jorge MB
**Category**: Feature
**Priority**: High

## Overview

Expand the multi-registry integration to support additional major model registries beyond Hugging Face. This phase adds support for ONNX Model Zoo, TensorFlow Hub, and PyTorch Hub, providing users with access to a much larger ecosystem of pre-trained models.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Implement `ONNXModelZooManager` for pre-optimized ONNX models
- Add `TensorFlowHubManager` for TensorFlow ecosystem models
- Create `PyTorchHubManager` for PyTorch ecosystem models
- Implement cross-registry search functionality
- Add model type detection across different registries
- Enhance CLI with registry selection and filtering

### Secondary Goals
- Create registry comparison and recommendation system
- Add model compatibility validation across registries
- Implement registry-specific optimization strategies
- Add support for model collections and categories

## Scope

### In Scope
- ONNX Model Zoo integration (100+ pre-optimized models)
- TensorFlow Hub integration (1000+ models)
- PyTorch Hub integration (100+ models)
- Cross-registry search and filtering
- Model type detection (text, vision, audio, etc.)
- Registry-specific optimization strategies
- Enhanced CLI with registry selection
- Model compatibility validation

### Out of Scope
- Enterprise registries (MLflow, Weights & Biases) - Phase 3
- Advanced features (batch operations, versioning) - Phase 3
- Custom registry support - Phase 4
- Enterprise authentication - Phase 4

## Deliverables

- [ ] `ONNXModelZooManager` implementation
- [ ] `TensorFlowHubManager` implementation
- [ ] `PyTorchHubManager` implementation
- [ ] Cross-registry search functionality
- [ ] Model type detection system
- [ ] Enhanced CLI with registry selection
- [ ] Registry comparison tools
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for all registries
- [ ] Documentation and examples for each registry

## Success Criteria

- Users can pull and run models from 4+ registries
- Cross-registry search returns relevant results from all sources
- 90%+ of popular models work across all registries
- Registry selection feels intuitive and natural
- Model type detection works for 95%+ of models
- All registries integrate seamlessly with existing GPUX runtime

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Phase 1 completion (ModelManager interface, HuggingFaceManager, CLI, ONNX conversion)
- Registry API documentation and access
- Test models from each registry

### Blockers
- Phase 1 must be completed successfully
- Registry API changes could impact implementation

### Parallel Work
- Each registry manager can be developed independently
- Documentation can be written alongside implementation
- Testing can be done in parallel

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| ONNX Model Zoo Integration | 2025-11-14 | [ ] | Pre-optimized models |
| TensorFlow Hub Integration | 2025-11-18 | [ ] | TensorFlow ecosystem |
| PyTorch Hub Integration | 2025-11-21 | [ ] | PyTorch ecosystem |
| Cross-Registry Features | 2025-11-25 | [ ] | Search, comparison, detection |

## Resources

### Team Members
- Lead Developer: Jorge MB
- Registry Specialists: TBD (for each registry)
- Testing: TBD

### External Resources
- ONNX Model Zoo API documentation
- TensorFlow Hub API documentation
- PyTorch Hub API documentation

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| API differences between registries | High | High | Use strategy pattern, thorough testing |
| Model format incompatibilities | Medium | Medium | Implement format conversion pipelines |
| Registry rate limiting | Medium | Medium | Implement caching and retry logic |
| Performance degradation with multiple registries | Low | Medium | Optimize search and caching |

## Progress Tracking

### Week 1 (2025-11-11 to 2025-11-18)
- [ ] Implement ONNXModelZooManager
- [ ] Add TensorFlow Hub integration
- [ ] Create cross-registry search foundation

### Week 2 (2025-11-19 to 2025-11-25)
- [ ] Implement PyTorchHubManager
- [ ] Add model type detection
- [ ] Enhance CLI with registry selection
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and validation

## Outcomes

### Achievements
- TBD (to be filled as phase progresses)

### Lessons Learned
- TBD (to be filled as phase progresses)

### Next Steps
- Move to Phase 3: Advanced Features (Enterprise registries, batch operations)
- Add model versioning and updates
- Implement cross-registry model comparison

## Notes

This phase significantly expands GPUX's model ecosystem access, making it a truly universal ML inference platform. The strategy pattern established in Phase 1 makes adding new registries straightforward.

**Key Success Factor**: Each registry has different APIs and capabilities, so the ModelManager interface must be flexible enough to accommodate these differences while maintaining a consistent user experience.
