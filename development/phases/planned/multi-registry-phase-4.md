## Notes

This phase completes the multi-registry integration feature, transforming GPUX into a comprehensive, enterprise-ready ML inference platform. The focus on custom registries and enterprise features positions GPUX as a serious competitor to existing ML platforms.

**Key Success Factor**: This phase must deliver production-ready, enterprise-grade features that can compete with established ML platforms. The custom registry framework and enterprise features are critical differentiators.

**Long-term Vision**: By the end of this phase, GPUX should be the go-to platform for ML inference across any registry, with enterprise-grade features that make it suitable for production use in large organizations.
