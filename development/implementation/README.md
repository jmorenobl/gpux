# Implementation Tracking

This directory tracks the implementation progress of features, tasks, and milestones.

## Subdirectories

- `tasks/` - Individual task tracking and progress
- `milestones/` - Major milestone tracking and deliverables
- `progress/` - Progress reports and status updates

## Implementation Lifecycle

1. **Planning** - Break down work into tasks and define acceptance criteria
2. **Development** - Implement features and functionality
3. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and validation
4. **Review** - Code review and quality assurance
5. **Integration** - Merge into main branch and integration testing
6. **Deployment** - Release and deployment activities
7. **Monitoring** - Post-deployment monitoring and feedback

## Task Management

### Task Status
- `[TODO]` - Task is defined but not started
- `[IN_PROGRESS]` - Task is currently being worked on
- `[REVIEW]` - Task is complete and under review
- `[BLOCKED]` - Task is blocked by dependencies or issues
- `[COMPLETED]` - Task is finished and verified
- `[CANCELLED]` - Task was cancelled with rationale

### Task Priority
- `Critical` - Must be completed for release
- `High` - Important for current milestone
- `Medium` - Important but can be deferred
- `Low` - Nice to have, can be deferred

### Task Size
- `XS` - < 1 day
- `S` - 1-2 days
- `M` - 3-5 days
- `L` - 1-2 weeks
- `XL` - 2+ weeks (should be broken down)
