**Task ID**: TASK-2025-07
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Assigned To**: Jorge MB
**Priority**: Medium
**Size**: M
**Estimated Hours**: 6 hours
**Actual Hours**: 6 hours

## Description

Validate Phase 1 success criteria through comprehensive performance benchmarking and testing with real models. This includes measuring conversion times, success rates, and validating the <30 second target for pull+convert+run workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Test with 5+ popular Hugging Face models
- [x] Measure conversion success rate (target: >90%)
- [x] Validate <30 second target for pull+convert+run workflow
- [x] Test cache hit rate (target: >80%)
- [x] Validate performance on multiple GPU types
- [x] Document performance characteristics
- [x] Create performance benchmark suite

## Technical Requirements

- Create automated benchmark suite
- Test with diverse model types (BERT, GPT, ResNet, etc.)
- Measure conversion times and success rates
- Test cache performance and hit rates
- Validate on Apple Silicon, NVIDIA, and AMD GPUs
- Document performance characteristics

## Implementation Details

### Benchmark Models
- **Text Models**: BERT-base, DistilBERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa
- **Vision Models**: ResNet-50, EfficientNet, ViT
- **Multimodal**: CLIP, BLIP

### Performance Metrics
- **Conversion Time**: Time from pull to run-ready
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful conversions
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Performance of caching system
- **Inference Speed**: Runtime performance comparison
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory consumption

### Test Scenarios
- Fresh model pull (no cache)
- Cached model usage
- Different GPU backends
- Various model sizes
- Error handling scenarios

## Dependencies

- All Phase 1 implementation tasks must be complete
- ModelManager interface working
- ONNX conversion pipeline functional
- Unified model discovery working

## Success Criteria

- 90%+ conversion success rate for supported models
- <30 second pull+convert+run workflow
- >80% cache hit rate for repeated usage
- Performance validation on multiple GPU types
- Comprehensive benchmark suite

## Notes

This task validates that Phase 1 meets all success criteria and provides performance baselines for future development. The benchmarks should be automated and repeatable for continuous validation.
