- `TEMPLATE_EXPERIMENT.md` - For experimental work
- `TEMPLATE_RESEARCH_NOTE.md` - For general research findings

## Benchmarking Guidelines

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: Time to complete single inference
- **Throughput**: Inferences per second
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **Accuracy**: Model output accuracy and precision
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, GPU, and memory usage

### Test Scenarios
