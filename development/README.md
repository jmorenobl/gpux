# Development Tracking

This directory contains all development-related documentation, ideas, and implementation tracking for the GPUX project.

## Usage Guidelines

### Ideas Management
- **Feature Ideas**: Document new features, enhancements, and user requests
- **Technical Ideas**: Explore technical concepts, architectural improvements
- **Research Notes**: Capture insights from external research and inspiration

### Phase Tracking
- **Current Phase**: Document what you're working on right now
- **Completed Phases**: Archive completed work with outcomes and lessons learned
- **Planned Phases**: Roadmap and upcoming development phases

### Implementation Tracking
- **Tasks**: Break down work into manageable, trackable tasks
- **Milestones**: Track major deliverables and deadlines
- **Progress**: Regular status updates and progress reports

### Research Documentation
- **Benchmarks**: Performance testing and comparison results
- **Experiments**: Proof-of-concept code and experimental features
- **External Resources**: Links to relevant research, documentation, and tools

### Decision Records
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document important technical decisions
- **Rationale**: Why decisions were made and alternatives considered
- **Impact**: Consequences and implications of decisions

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names: `feature-name.md`
- Include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format when relevant: `2024-01-15-feature-name.md`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Add status prefixes when appropriate: `[DRAFT]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[ACCEPTED]`

## Integration with Git

### Hybrid Approach
This development directory uses a hybrid approach to version control:

**Tracked in Git:**
- ✅ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - important decisions
- ✅ Completed phases - historical record
- ✅ Major milestones - project progress
- ✅ Benchmark results - performance data
- ✅ Idea documents - concept exploration
- ✅ README files and templates - documentation

**Ignored by Git:**
- ❌ Working drafts and temporary files
- ❌ Personal notes and private thoughts
- ❌ Large files (PDFs, archives, etc.)
- ❌ IDE and OS generated files

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commit messages for tracked development documentation
- Link development docs to relevant code changes and pull requests
- Consider using git tags to mark major development milestones
- Keep working files local until they're ready for sharing

## How to Use

### Working with Files

1. **Create working files** with suffixes like `_draft.md`, `_working.md`, `_notes.md` - these will be ignored by git
2. **When ready to share**, rename to remove the suffix and commit
3. **Use the tracked directories** for important, shareable content
4. **Keep personal notes** in subdirectories that are ignored

### File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names: `feature-name.md`
- Include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format when relevant: `2024-01-15-feature-name.md`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Add status prefixes when appropriate: `[DRAFT]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[ACCEPTED]`

### Workflow Examples

**For Ideas:**
1. Create `development/ideas/technical-ideas/new-feature_draft.md` for initial brainstorming
2. When ready, rename to `new-feature.md` and commit
3. Move to `development/ideas/feature-requests/` when it becomes a formal request

**For Phases:**
1. Create `development/phases/planned/phase-name_draft.md` for planning
2. Move to `development/phases/current/` when phase starts
3. Move to `development/phases/completed/` when finished

**For Decisions:**
1. Create `development/decisions/proposed/ADR-001_draft.md` for initial proposal
2. Rename to `ADR-001.md` when ready for team review
3. Move to `development/decisions/accepted/` when decision is made

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep documentation current and up-to-date
2. **Clear Structure**: Follow the established directory structure
3. **Cross-References**: Link related documents and decisions
4. **Status Tracking**: Clearly mark the status of ideas, phases, and decisions
5. **Review Process**: Regularly review and archive outdated content
6. **Searchability**: Use consistent keywords and tags for easy searching

## Templates

Each subdirectory contains template files to ensure consistency:
- `TEMPLATE_IDEA.md` - For documenting new ideas
- `TEMPLATE_PHASE.md` - For documenting development phases
- `TEMPLATE_TASK.md` - For tracking implementation tasks
- `TEMPLATE_DECISION.md` - For architecture decision records

## Integration with Project Management

This development tracking system complements but doesn't replace:
- GitHub Issues for bug tracking
- GitHub Projects for task management
- Pull requests for code review
- Milestones for release planning

The development directory serves as a comprehensive knowledge base and planning tool for the project.
